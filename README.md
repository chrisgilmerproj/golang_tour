Getting Started
---

Easiest way to get started is:

```sh
$ brew install go
```

Then make sure you have a go path set up:

```sh
$ mkdir ~/go
$ export GOPATH=~/go
```

Make sure to put `export GOPATH=~/go` into your `.bashrc`.

Then run any one of these files using:

```sh
$ go run 01_basics/01_packages.go
```
